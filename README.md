This project was created to enhance and showcase competency I've built up for C#, .NET Core, Entity Framework Core (ORM), API design, Database Design/Migrations, Unit and Integration testing, and CI testing with Travis CI.

To get code merged into master, the pull request which contains the new code must pass all of its tests.
